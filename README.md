This continues from week 2.
Futher feaures were added to the convenience store
The cashier sells product based on a priority queue
of the quantity of each product all the customers are
buying and a FIFO of the customers.
So if the 3 customers are buying bread, jam and sweets,
each product of each constumer is placed in a priority
queue of the product and the customers with the greatest
quantity of a particular product is sold that product 
first. If two or more customers have equal quantity of
a particular product, the cashier sell based on FIFO 
of the customers in the customer queue.
